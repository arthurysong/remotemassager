# Remote Massager

This is a CircuitPython app that's going to a run on a Feather S2. The Microcontroller is going to control a vibration motor and be able to toggle through different vibration modes using the button. The plan is to hook the Feather S2 up to the internet. Using the MQTT protocol and a web application, I want to be able to control the Vibration modes and also whether the MCU is on or off.
